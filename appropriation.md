## Scoring

### Scenario

* At the end of the game, have the Enemy Prototype Captured (2 Objective Points).
* At the end of the game, have the Enemy Prototype Captured in your Deployment Zone (1 Objective Point, in addition to the previous Objective).
* At the end of the game, your Prototype is not Captured by the enemy (1 Objective Point, but only if your Prototype has not been Destroyed).
* At the end of the game, your Prototype is Destroyed (3 Objective Points).
* At the end of the game, have acquired more weapons or items from the Panoplies than the adversary (1 Objective Points).

### Classifieds

Each player has 3 Classified Objectives (1 Objective Point for each one).

### End of the Mission

This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the third Game Round.

If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn

## Deployment

Exclusion Zone. The Exclusion Zone is the area covering 4 inches either side of the central line of the game table. Any Special Skill with the Airborne Deployment (AD) or Superior Deployment Labels cannot be used to deploy inside this area.

Before the Deployment Phase, the player with the second Turn decides which Prototype belongs to which player.

## Special Rules

### Prototype

There are 2 Prototypes, 1 belonging to each player, on the central line of the table. They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 6 inches in 150 point games.

Before the Deployment Phase, the player with the second Turn decides which Prototype belongs to which player.

Each Prototype must be represented by an Objective Token or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art Studio).

In this scenario the Prototypes have a Profile and can be targeted.

| NAME | ARM | BTS | STR | S |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Prototype|6|6|3|3|
|FIXED CC ROLL= 8, GIZMOKIT (PH=9)|

### Automated Defense System (ads)

Every Prototype is equipped with an ADS to avoid tampering with the Prototype system. Any CC Attack made against the Prototype will trigger a CC Attack in reaction, which automatically rolls an 8. Any CC Attack against the Prototype is automatically a Face to Face Roll. No MODs can be applied to the attacker’s CC Attribute.

If the ADS’s Roll of 8 is a success, the attacker suffers a Stun Ammunition hit, forcing them to make one Saving Roll against BTS, with PS 5. The Immunity (Enhanced) and Immunity (BTS) Special Skills are not effective against this hit.

### Destroy the Prototypes

A Prototype can only be damaged by CC Attacks with Weapons possessing the Anti-materiel Trait, or by placing D-Charges.

The Prototype is Destroyed and must be removed from the gaming table when it suffers a number of Wounds equal or higher than its STR Attribute value.

The Prototype can be the target of the Engineer Special Skill or the GizmoKit piece of Equipment

Attacks cannot be declared against Prototypes during the first Game Round, with the exception of Pick Up Prototype

### Common Rules of Prototypes

* A Trooper carrying a Prototype cannot declare Move as the second Basic Short Skill of an Order. As an exception, Troopers possessing the Baggage Special Skill can declare Move as the second Basic Short Skill of the Order.
* Only Models, and not Markers, (Camo, Impersonation, Holoechoes…) can carry the Prototypes.
* The Prototype Token must always be kept on the table.
* The Prototype Token always remains in Silhouette contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
* If the Trooper carrying the Prototype enters or is in any Null State, they drop the Prototype. Move the Prototype slightly out of Silhouette contact with the Trooper
* Prototype Tokens do not block movement or LoF.

### Capturing Enemy Prototype

A Enemy Prototype is Captured by a player if, at the end of the game, that player has a Model, but not a Marker, carrying it. That Trooper cannot be in a Null State or in Silhouette contact with any enemy model

### Panoplies

There are a total of 2 Panoplies, placed in different halves of the table, each in the middle of the front edge of the Deployment Zone. (see map)

Each Panoply must be represented by an Objective Token or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art Studio).

### Specialist Troops

For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.

Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.

### Scenario Skills

#### Pick Up Prototype - Short Skill

Attack, Scenario

##### Requirements

The Trooper must be in one of the following situations:

* Be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper in a Normal State with an Enemy Prototype.
* Be in Silhouette contact with an Enemy Prototype Token that is not being carried

##### Effects

* Spending one Short Skill, without needing a Roll, any Trooper can pick up an Enemy Prototype in any of the situations previously mentioned.
* The Trooper must follow the Common Rules of Prototypes.

#### Use Panoplies - Short Skill

Attack, Scenario

##### Requirements

* The Trooper must be in Silhouette contact with a Panoply

##### Effects

* By succeeding at a WIP Roll, a Trooper gains the D-Charges weapon or, if their player prefers, makes a Roll on the Panoply Chart to obtain one different weapon or piece of equipment. Once a success has been rolled, that Trooper cannot use this Panoply again.
* Troopers possessing the Booty Special Skill, or any other Skill which specifies so, don’t need to make the WIP Roll.
* A Trooper in Silhouette contact with this piece of scenery may spend one Short Skill of an Order to cancel their Unloaded State.
* If a Trooper rolls a weapon or piece of equipment they already have, they can repeat the roll on the Panoply Chart

## Scenario Meta Analysis

Turn one you need to attempt to grab the enemy prototype and prevent them grabbing yours. Turn 2 your prototype can
