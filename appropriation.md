## Scoring

### Scenario

* At the end of the game, have the Enemy Prototype Captured (2 Objective Points).
* At the end of the game, have the Enemy Prototype Captured in your Deployment Zone (1 Objective Point, in addition to the previous Objective).
* At the end of the game, your Prototype is not Captured by the enemy (1 Objective Point, but only if your Prototype has not been Destroyed).
* At the end of the game, your Prototype is Destroyed (3 Objective Points).
* At the end of the game, have acquired more weapons or items from the Panoplies than the adversary (1 Objective Points).

### Classifieds

Each player has 3 Classified Objectives (1 Objective Point for each one).

### End of the Mission

This scenario has a limited time frame, so it will automatically finish at the end of the third Game Round.

If one of the players starts their Active Turn in a Retreat! situation, the game will end at the end of that Turn

## Deployment

Exclusion Zone. The Exclusion Zone is the area covering 4 inches either side of the central line of the game table. Any Special Skill with the Airborne Deployment (AD) or Superior Deployment Labels cannot be used to deploy inside this area.

Before the Deployment Phase, the player with the second Turn decides which Prototype belongs to which player.

## Special Rules

### Prototype

There are 2 Prototypes, 1 belonging to each player, on the central line of the table. They are placed 12 inches from the table edges in 300/350/400 point games, 8 inches in 200/250 point games, and 6 inches in 150 point games.

Before the Deployment Phase, the player with the second Turn decides which Prototype belongs to which player.

Each Prototype must be represented by an Objective Token or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art Studio).

In this scenario the Prototypes have a Profile and can be targeted.

| NAME | ARM | BTS | STR | S |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|Prototype|6|6|3|3|
|FIXED CC ROLL= 8, GIZMOKIT (PH=9)|

### Automated Defense System (ads)

Every Prototype is equipped with an ADS to avoid tampering with the Prototype system. Any CC Attack made against the Prototype will trigger a CC Attack in reaction, which automatically rolls an 8. Any CC Attack against the Prototype is automatically a Face to Face Roll. No MODs can be applied to the attacker’s CC Attribute.

If the ADS’s Roll of 8 is a success, the attacker suffers a Stun Ammunition hit, forcing them to make one Saving Roll against BTS, with PS 5. The Immunity (Enhanced) and Immunity (BTS) Special Skills are not effective against this hit.

### Destroy the Prototypes

A Prototype can only be damaged by CC Attacks with Weapons possessing the Anti-materiel Trait, or by placing D-Charges.

The Prototype is Destroyed and must be removed from the gaming table when it suffers a number of Wounds equal or higher than its STR Attribute value.

The Prototype can be the target of the Engineer Special Skill or the GizmoKit piece of Equipment

Attacks cannot be declared against Prototypes during the first Game Round, with the exception of Pick Up Prototype

### Common Rules of Prototypes

* A Trooper carrying a Prototype cannot declare Move as the second Basic Short Skill of an Order. As an exception, Troopers possessing the Baggage Special Skill can declare Move as the second Basic Short Skill of the Order.
* Only Models, and not Markers, (Camo, Impersonation, Holoechoes…) can carry the Prototypes.
* The Prototype Token must always be kept on the table.
* The Prototype Token always remains in Silhouette contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
* If the Trooper carrying the Prototype enters or is in any Null State, they drop the Prototype. Move the Prototype slightly out of Silhouette contact with the Trooper
* Prototype Tokens do not block movement or LoF.

### Capturing Enemy Prototype

A Enemy Prototype is Captured by a player if, at the end of the game, that player has a Model, but not a Marker, carrying it. That Trooper cannot be in a Null State or in Silhouette contact with any enemy model

### Panoplies

There are a total of 2 Panoplies, placed in different halves of the table, each in the middle of the front edge of the Deployment Zone. (see map)

Each Panoply must be represented by an Objective Token or by a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Objective of the ITS Objectives Pack or the Alpha Info Hubs by Micro Art Studio).

### Specialist Troops

For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.

Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.

### Scenario Skills

#### Pick Up Prototype - Short Skill

Attack, Scenario

##### Requirements

The Trooper must be in one of the following situations:

* Be in Silhouette contact with an allied Trooper in a Normal State with an Enemy Prototype.
* Be in Silhouette contact with an Enemy Prototype Token that is not being carried

##### Effects

* Spending one Short Skill, without needing a Roll, any Trooper can pick up an Enemy Prototype in any of the situations previously mentioned.
* The Trooper must follow the Common Rules of Prototypes.

#### Use Panoplies - Short Skill

Attack, Scenario

##### Requirements

* The Trooper must be in Silhouette contact with a Panoply

##### Effects

* By succeeding at a WIP Roll, a Trooper gains the D-Charges weapon or, if their player prefers, makes a Roll on the Panoply Chart to obtain one different weapon or piece of equipment. Once a success has been rolled, that Trooper cannot use this Panoply again.
* Troopers possessing the Booty Special Skill, or any other Skill which specifies so, don’t need to make the WIP Roll.
* A Trooper in Silhouette contact with this piece of scenery may spend one Short Skill of an Order to cancel their Unloaded State.
* If a Trooper rolls a weapon or piece of equipment they already have, they can repeat the roll on the Panoply Chart

## Scenario Meta Analysis

Turn one you need to attempt to grab the enemy prototype and prevent them grabbing yours. Turn 2 your prototype can be destroyed with either CC or D-Charges. D-charges are the 'correct' choice (AP+EXP, auto hit, and you dont catch an auto CC-ARO), and you may equip anyone in your army with them via the panoply mechanic. The player with the second turn picks which prototype is which, so there's some level of advantage in chosing to go second assuming you're confident that you can prevent your opponent completing a turn 1 grab (watch out for motorbikes and super jump units).

The win condition here has some nuance. Either destroying your prototype or having the enemy prototype in your DZ is worth 3 points, but if you're in a position to pull these both off you've likely dismantled your opponent in turn 1 (which is a valid strategy, just not one you should rely on). If we're more realistic though i'd expec that a lot of the time we'll find either both get extracted or both get destroyed, meaning you're likely tied on points so the winner will come down to the 3 classifieds and the panoply mechanic (whoever has the most uses gets 1 OP). The panoply mechanic might be glossed over, so where you can spare orders and have valid units nearby (1 use per model) it might be worth doing a couple times to secure the 1 OP.

For a strategy of securing the prototype you really want aim to have this in hand in turn 1, while also setting up defences to prevent your own prototype being taken. As such you want to ensure you're bringing robust high movement troops and/or vision control to prevent your opponents ARO's stopping you getting as far back into your own defences as possible. Specialist troops with infiltrate and hidden deployment will be highly valuable here, especially if you take the first activation of turn 1 before your opponent has the chance to deploy defences up the board, vision control to prevent your enemy from shooting the unit securing the prototype and retreating is also an excellent strategy. On the flip side of this hidden deployment pieces with infiltrate / minelayer / network projection / glue will be highly effective for defence, especially if you can manage a fork (mines and oblivion firing off forcing a choice of reset or dodge) will be highly effective. TR bots and other ARO pieces will also be effective, just be aware of placement to deal with vision control.

For destroying the prototype from turn 2 on the statistics say that 2 d-charges should be sufficient to destroy your prototype (though keep enough orders up your sleeve to use all 3), however you need it to not be in the enemy's hands on turn 2. You can either achieve this by preventing them retrieving it at all in turn 1, or killing the unit who has taken it in turn one and then utilising a parachutist/combat drop troop (generally comes with d-charges). As in turn 1, vision control for your d-charge unit(s) will allow you to complete this unmolested.
