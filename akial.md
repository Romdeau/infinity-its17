# Akial Interference

## Scoring

### Scenario

* Accomplish Common Classified Objectives (1 Objective Point for each, up to a maximum of 6 Objective Points).
* At the end of the game, have accomplished more Classified Objectives than the adversary (1 Objective Point).
* At the end of the game, have accomplished at least 1 Classified Objective in each Game Round (1 Objective Point, even if the Classified Objective gets canceled for that player).

### Classifieds

* Each player has 1 Private Classified Objective (2 Objective Points).

## Deployment

It is not allowed to deploy in Silhouette contact with the Akial Antenna or with any HVT.

## Special Rules

### Common Classified Objectives

Both players share 2 Common Classified Objectives each Game Round, which are Public Information.

At the beginning of the first Game Round, each player must shuffle their Classified Deck in front of their opponent. Then each player must draw two cards, select one of them as their Private Classified Objective, and the other as a Common Classified Objective for the first Game Round. Once both players have selected a Common Classified Objective, they are revealed at the same time.

At the beginning of Game Rounds two and three, any current Common Classified Objective cards that have not been accomplished by either player are discarded. The Common Classified Objective cards that have been accomplished are moved to a separate area, so that each player can keep track of which cards have been accomplished. Player A and Player B Tokens can be used to mark which player has accomplished each Common Classified Objective card. It is recommended each player uses a different kind of Token.

Each player then draws two cards from their Classified Deck, chooses one as a Common Classified Objective, and discards the other.

Any Common Classified Objective that is checked “at the end of the game” or “during the game” can be accomplished at the end of any Player Turn. If both players accomplished the same Common Classified Objective in the same Round, both players have accomplished it. A Common Classified Objective can only be accomplished after it has been drawn.

If a player’s deck runs out of cards, shuffle their discard pile into a new deck.

### Private Classified Objective

A Private Classified Objective cannot be used to Emit Akial Interference, and cannot be canceled by it.

The Private Classified Objectives are Private Information.

### Signal Redundancy

If, upon revealing the Common Classified Objectives, both have the same name, the player with the first Player Turn must draw another card from their Classified Deck and place it as an extra Common Classified Objective.

Two Classified Objectives with the same name, whether Common or Private, can both be accomplished in the same Player Turn as long as they each have a different target or are accomplished by a different Trooper.

### Multiple HVTs

Each of the players will deploy four HVTs, following the usual rules for deploying HVTs. Each HVT may only be used to accomplish one Classified Objective - once a Classified Objective targeting an HVT has been completed, that HVT Model is removed from the game table.

### Secure HVT or Secure Treasure Not Used

In this scenario, the Secure HVT or Secure Treasure rule is not
applied.

### Akial Antenna

There is 1 Akial Antenna placed in the center of the table.

The Akial Antenna must be represented by a Transmission Antenna Token (TRANS. ANTENNA) or with a scenery piece of the same diameter (such as the Antenna of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Communications Array by Warsenal or the Sat Station Antenna by Customeeple).

#### Emit Akial Interference

Short skill, specialist only

Req: You have accomplished a Common Classified with one of the 4 symbols (Hacker, FO, Doctor, Eng)

#### Filter the Signal

Short skill, specialist only

## Scenario Meta Analysis

Max OP is 10. First player strat would be to complete a classified then filter the signal, second player strat is to complete a classified and if the other player also completed it to emit akial interference. Provided you are confident you can control the antenna I believe that going second is the correct choice, as provided you can complete any objective your opponent does you can actively prevent them scoring. This would leave them with the only scoring opportunity being 1 completion per turn (cancellation does not count against this) and their private classified.
