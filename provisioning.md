# Provisioning

## Scoring

### Scenario

* At the end of the game, Control a Supply Box (1 Objective Point for each Supply Box).
* At the end of the game, Control more Supply Boxes in your own Safe Area than your adversary in their own Safe Area (3 Objective Points).
* At the end of the game, Control the same number of Supply Boxes in your Safe Area than the adversary does in their Safe Area (1 Objective Point, but only if at least 1 Supply Box is Controlled in their Safe Area).
* At the end of the game, if your adversary does not Control any Supply Boxes in their Safe Area (2 Objective Points).

### Classifieds

* Each player has 1 Classified Objective (1 Objective)

## Deployment

It is not allowed to deploy in Silhouette contact with a Tech-Coffin.

The distance from deployment zone to the center point (at the closest point) is just shy of 10".

## Special Rules

### Tech-Coffins

There are a total of 3 Tech-Coffins. One of them is placed in the center of the table while the other two are placed along the central diagonal line of the table, at 16 inches from the central Tech-Coffin (12 inches in 200/250 point games, and 8 inches in 150 point games) (see map). Each Tech-Coffin contains one Supply Box, except for the central Tech-Coffin which contains two Supply Boxes.

The Tech-Coffins must be represented by a Tech-Coffin Marker or with a scenery piece of the same diameter (Such as the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, Stasis Coffins by Warsenal or the Cryo Pods by Customeeple).

### Supply Boxes

The Supply Boxes must be represented by a Supply Box Marker, or a similar scenery item (Such as the Supply Boxes of the ITS Objective Pack Alpha, the Tech Crates by Micro Art Studio, the Gang Tie Containers by Bandua Wargames, the Supply Boxes by Warsenal or the Cargo Crates by Customeeple).

### Scenario Skills

#### Extract Supply Boxes

Special Skill while in base contact with the tech-coffin.

Make a normal WIP roll to extract and pick up a Supply Box. When successful place a supply box token beside the trooper. If the roll is failed this may be repeated as many times as required. Once all supply boxes have been extracted from a tech coffin place a token next to it to indicate that it is empty.

#### Pick Up Supply Boxes

Normal short skill for any trooper, however extracting from an enemy safe zone requires a specialist.

### Common Rules of Supply Boxes

* Each Model can carry a maximum of 1 Supply Box. As an exception, Models possessing the Baggage Special Skill can carry up to 2 Supply Boxes.
* Only Models, and not Markers, (Camo, Impersonation, Holoechoes…) can carry the Supply Boxes.
* The Supply Box Token must always be kept on the table.
* The Supply Box Token always remains in Silhouette contact with the Trooper which is carrying it.
* If the Trooper carrying the Supply Box enters or is in any Null State, they drop the Supply Box. Move the Supply Box Token slightly out of Silhouette contact with the Trooper.
* Supply Box Tokens don’t block movement or LoF.

### Controlling the Supply Boxes

A Supply Box is Controlled by a player if, at the end of the game, that player has a Model, but not a Marker, carrying it. That Trooper cannot be in a Null State or in Silhouette contact with any enemy Model. Supply Boxes in a player’s Safe Area are Controlled by that player unless an enemy Specialist Troop is carrying it.

### Safe Area

Each player has a Safe Area where they must deposit the Supply Boxes.

Before the Deployment Phase, each player must place one Circular Template. It can be placed on any surface of the game table that is equal or larger in size than the Template, must be completely outside any Deployment Zones, and cannot overlap another Safe Area.

The player that kept Deployment must place their Circular Template first.

Any Trooper may put down a Supply Box in a Safe Area by spending one Short Skill, without needing to perform a Roll. The Trooper must place the Supply Box totally inside the Safe Area. Only Specialist Troops may pick up a Supply Box from the enemy’s Safe Area, using the Pick Up Supply Boxes Short Skill.

### Specialist Troops

For the purposes of this scenario, only Hackers, Doctors, Engineers, Forward Observers, Paramedics, and Troopers possessing the Chain of Command or the Specialist Operative Special Skill are considered Specialist Troops.

Hackers, Doctors, and Engineers cannot make use of Repeaters or Peripheral (Servant) Models to perform tasks reserved for Specialist Troops.

### Operational Learning

When a Specialist Troop performs a Skill with the Scenario Label that requires a WIP Roll and fails, they benefit from the following MODs in subsequent Orders:

* In the second consecutive Order, the Trooper applies a +3 MOD to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
* In the third consecutive Order—and subsequent Orders— the Trooper applies +3 and +1SD MODs to the WIP Roll required for that Scenario Skill.
* These MODs are cumulative with any other MOD that applies to skills with the Scenario Label

## Scenario Meta Analysis

Winning is going to hinge entirely on safe zone placement, which is going to hinge on how confident you are in your army's mobility and how the terrain on the board is placed. If you're confident in your ability to hold the mid board setting your safe zone between two tech coffins is the play, if you can rapidly move boxes then having a further away safe zone to capitalise on this speed to make retrieving the boxes order intensive for the enemy is the play. The player going first wants to secure at least 2 boxes in their turn, or setup a structure where the other player is going to have a very unpleasant time securing boxes. The player going second sets the win condition, if you're going second and at any point in turn 3 have 2 boxes in your safe zone while the enemy has 1 or less you should immediately pass your turn and end the game (as this nets you 5 OP, which will be 5 TP).
